## The Python Tutorial

A tour of the noteworthy features of the Python Language and introduces the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). Python Docs also offer a glossary of terms [[py-docs-glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#glossary)]


### Whetting your Appetite

`[?]` What problems does Python solve?  
`[>]` Slow development cycles like that of C/C++/Java, requiring write/compile/test/re-compiles. This is particularly true if you want to quickly write a test suite for a C/C++ library, writing it in Python is must faster.

`[?]` Why might you use python over Bash scripts?
`[>]` Python is portable across many platforms and is a fully features programming language unlike Bash.

`[?]` What are high-level data typses?  

`[?]` Why might an interpreted language be an advantage?  
`[>]` No compiling and linking is necessary. The code can be written interactive thanks to this. This is helpful to bottom-up development of a program.




### Invoking the Interpretor

`[?]` Where is the python interpreter usually stored?
`[>]` `/usr/local/bin/python3.9`. Usually placed in the `PATH` variable to make it aviaalbel in the shell directly.



```{python}
# ! python3 --version
```

Invoke a command or module directly through an interpreter.  
`python -c command [arg]`  
`python -m module [arg]`  

Invoke a script and then interact with it.  
`python script.py -1`


`[?]` What encoding do python script usually treated as?  
`[>]` UTF-8


`[?]` How do you declare an encoding that is different to UTF-8 in a script? 

```{python}
# -*- coding: encoding -*-

# or 

# #!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
```

### An Informal Introduction to Python

`[?]` What data type does the `/` division return?  
`[>]` floating point number

```{python}
type(8/5)
```

```{python}
type(8/4)
```

`[?]` Does floor division `//` yield a `float` data type?  
`[>]` No, always an `int`.

```{python}
type(8//5)
```

```{python}
type(8%5)
```

`[?]` What notation is used for floor and remainder divisons?  
`[?]` What happens when you declare a variable that matches a function?

```{python}
round(5.86,0)
```

```{python}
round = 5.596
```

```{python}
# round(5.86,0) # TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

```{python}

```
