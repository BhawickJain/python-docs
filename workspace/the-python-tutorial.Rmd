## The Python Tutorial

A tour of the noteworthy features of the Python Language and introduces the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). Python Docs also offer a glossary of terms [[py-docs-glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#glossary)]


### Whetting your Appetite

`[?]` What problems does Python solve?  
`[>]` Slow development cycles like that of C/C++/Java, requiring write/compile/test/re-compiles. This is particularly true if you want to quickly write a test suite for a C/C++ library, writing it in Python is must faster.

`[?]` Why might you use python over Bash scripts?
`[>]` Python is portable across many platforms and is a fully features programming language unlike Bash.

`[?]` What are high-level data typses?  

`[?]` Why might an interpreted language be an advantage?  
`[>]` No compiling and linking is necessary. The code can be written interactive thanks to this. This is helpful to bottom-up development of a program.




### Invoking the Interpretor

`[?]` Where is the python interpreter usually stored?
`[>]` `/usr/local/bin/python3.9`. Usually placed in the `PATH` variable to make it aviaalbel in the shell directly.



```{python}
# ! python3 --version
```

Invoke a command or module directly through an interpreter.  
`python -c command [arg]`  
`python -m module [arg]`  

Invoke a script and then interact with it.  
`python script.py -1`


`[?]` What encoding do python script usually treated as?  
`[>]` UTF-8


`[?]` How do you declare an encoding that is different to UTF-8 in a script? 

```{python}
# -*- coding: encoding -*-

# or 

# #!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
```

### An Informal Introduction to Python


__Numbers__

`[?]` What data type does the `/` division return?  
`[>]` floating point number

```{python}
type(8/5)
```

```{python}
type(8/4)
```

`[?]` Does floor division `//` yield a `float` data type?  
`[>]` No, always an `int`.

```{python}
type(8//5)
```

```{python}
type(8%5)
```

`[?]` What notation is used for floor and remainder divisons?  


`[?]` What happens when you declare a variable that matches a function?  
`[>]` You mask the function with the local variable making it inaccessible.

```{python}
round(5.86,0)
```

```{python}
round = 5.596
```

```{python}
# round(5.86,0) # TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

`[ ]` Create an example that uses `Decimal`, `Fraction` and `ComplexNumbers` objects.


__Strings__

`"..."` `'...'` to write strings with `\` to escape characters.

```{python}
text = 'is\'t it great!'
text
```

or just do this

```{python}
text = "is't is great"
text
```

```{python}
print('first line.\nsecond line')
```

`[?]` When placing `\n` in a string, do you need a space after it?  


`[?]` When `\n` is placed inside a string variable, what happens?

```{python}
a = "first line.\nsecond line"
a
```

```{python}
print(a)
```

You need the `print()` function to make use of the `\n` or equivalent.


`[?]` How can you escape characters in a string without `\`?
`[>]` Write the `r` character right before the quote to treat it as a raw text.

```{python}
print('C:\some\name')
```

```{python}
print(r'C:\some\name')
```

`[?]` How do you prevent a new line from printing when using triple-quote literals `"""..."""` and `'''...'''`?

```{python}
print("""
Usage: thing [OPTIONS]
    -h                           Display this usage message
    -H hostname                  Hostname to connect to
""")
```

Use `\` at the end of the line to remove the spare newline right at the start.

```{python}
print("""\
Usage: thing [OPTIONS]
    -h                           Display this usage message
    -H hostname                  Hostname to connect to
""")
```

```{python}
a = """\
Usage: thing [OPTIONS]
    -h                           Display this usage message
    -H hostname                  Hostname to connect to
"""
a
```

```{python}
print(a)
```

`[?]` What happens when you do the following?

```{python}
'py' 'thon'
```

`[?]`What happens when you do the following?

```{python}
3 * 'w' + '.google.com'
```

`[?]` What happens when you do the following?

```{python}
a = ('These are several string within parentheses '
     'what do you think happens?')
a
```

`[?]` When might it be useful?  
`[>]` Allows for a body of text to be placed without need to wrap text.


`[?]` When doesn't it work?

```{python}
b = 'what do you think happens?'
a = ('These are several string within parentheses '
     b)
```

```{python}
prefix = 'Py'
# prefix 'thon'
```

```{python}
prefix = 'Py'
prefix + 'thon'
```

__Slicing Strings__


`[?]` How do you select the second last character of a string?  

```{python}
word = 'python'
word[0]   # first character
word[-1]  # last character
word[-2]  # second last character
word[-6]  # first character
```

`[?]` How do you substring?

```{python}
word[:5]  # 0 to 4 char positions
```

The last number is always ignored. This enables the complementary substring slices to equal the complete word:

```{python}
word[:2] + word[2:]
```

```{python}
word[-2:] # last two char
```

```{python}
word[4:5] # fifth character, equivalent to word[4]
```

```{python}
word[2:80] # over extending the index leads to just returning 
```

yet when referring to the index directly will result in a type error.

```{python}
# word[80] # IndexError
```

```{python}
word[2:6] # word is 6 characters long
```

```{python}
word[2:5] # although last char is at position 5, the last position is ignored.
```

`[?]` What might be another way to remember the indices in a slice?  
`[>]` The indices can be treated as through they point between the numbers.


```
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
```


`[?]` Can you change a single character of a string?

```{python}
# word[0] = 'j' # TypeError
```

You need to create a new string

```{python}
'j' + word[1:]
```

`[?]` How do you find the length of a string?

```{python}
len(word)
```
