## The Python Tutorial
[[doc](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)]

A tour of the noteworthy features of the Python Language and introduces the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html#library-index). Python Docs also offer a glossary of terms [[py-docs-glossary](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#glossary)]


### Whetting your Appetite

`[?]` What problems does Python solve?  
`[>]` Slow development cycles like that of C/C++/Java, requiring write/compile/test/re-compiles. This is particularly true if you want to quickly write a test suite for a C/C++ library, writing it in Python is must faster.

`[?]` Why might you use python over Bash scripts?
`[>]` Python is portable across many platforms and is a fully features programming language unlike Bash.

`[?]` What are high-level data typses?  

`[?]` Why might an interpreted language be an advantage?  
`[>]` No compiling and linking is necessary. The code can be written interactive thanks to this. This is helpful to bottom-up development of a program.




### Invoking the Interpretor

`[?]` Where is the python interpreter usually stored?
`[>]` `/usr/local/bin/python3.9`. Usually placed in the `PATH` variable to make it aviaalbel in the shell directly.



```{python}
# ! python3 --version
```

Invoke a command or module directly through an interpreter.  
`python -c command [arg]`  
`python -m module [arg]`  

Invoke a script and then interact with it.  
`python script.py -1`


`[?]` What encoding do python script usually treated as?  
`[>]` UTF-8


`[?]` How do you declare an encoding that is different to UTF-8 in a script? 

```{python}
# -*- coding: encoding -*-

# or 

# #!/usr/bin/env python3
# -*- coding: encoding -*-
```

### An Informal Introduction to Python


__Numbers__

`[?]` What data type does the `/` division return?  
`[>]` floating point number

```{python}
type(8/5)
```

```{python}
type(8/4)
```

`[?]` Does floor division `//` yield a `float` data type?  
`[>]` No, always an `int`.

```{python}
type(8//5)
```

```{python}
type(8%5)
```

`[?]` What notation is used for floor and remainder divisons?  


`[?]` What happens when you declare a variable that matches a function?  
`[>]` You mask the function with the local variable making it inaccessible.

```{python}
round(5.86,0)
```

```{python}
round = 5.596
```

```{python}
# round(5.86,0) # TypeError: 'float' object is not callable
```

`[ ]` Create an example that uses `Decimal`, `Fraction` and `ComplexNumbers` objects.


__Strings__

`"..."` `'...'` to write strings with `\` to escape characters.

```{python}
text = 'is\'t it great!'
text
```

or just do this

```{python}
text = "is't is great"
text
```

```{python}
print('first line.\nsecond line')
```

`[?]` When placing `\n` in a string, do you need a space after it?  


`[?]` When `\n` is placed inside a string variable, what happens?

```{python}
a = "first line.\nsecond line"
a
```

```{python}
print(a)
```

You need the `print()` function to make use of the `\n` or equivalent.


`[?]` How can you escape characters in a string without `\`?
`[>]` Write the `r` character right before the quote to treat it as a raw text.

```{python}
print('C:\some\name')
```

```{python}
print(r'C:\some\name')
```

`[?]` How do you prevent a new line from printing when using triple-quote literals `"""..."""` and `'''...'''`?

```{python}
print("""
Usage: thing [OPTIONS]
    -h                           Display this usage message
    -H hostname                  Hostname to connect to
""")
```

Use `\` at the end of the line to remove the spare newline right at the start.

```{python}
print("""\
Usage: thing [OPTIONS]
    -h                           Display this usage message
    -H hostname                  Hostname to connect to
""")
```

```{python}
a = """\
Usage: thing [OPTIONS]
    -h                           Display this usage message
    -H hostname                  Hostname to connect to
"""
a
```

```{python}
print(a)
```

`[?]` What happens when you do the following?

```{python}
'py' 'thon'
```

`[?]`What happens when you do the following?

```{python}
3 * 'w' + '.google.com'
```

`[?]` What happens when you do the following?

```{python}
a = ('These are several string within parentheses '
     'what do you think happens?')
a
```

`[?]` When might it be useful?  
`[>]` Allows for a body of text to be placed without need to wrap text.


`[?]` When doesn't it work?

```{python}
b = 'what do you think happens?'
a = ('These are several string within parentheses '
     b)
```

```{python}
prefix = 'Py'
# prefix 'thon'
```

```{python}
prefix = 'Py'
prefix + 'thon'
```

__Slicing Strings__


`[?]` How do you select the second last character of a string?  

```{python}
word = 'python'
word[0]   # first character
word[-1]  # last character
word[-2]  # second last character
word[-6]  # first character
```

`[?]` How do you substring?

```{python}
word[:5]  # 0 to 4 char positions
```

The last number is always ignored. This enables the complementary substring slices to equal the complete word:

```{python}
word[:2] + word[2:]
```

```{python}
word[-2:] # last two char
```

```{python}
word[4:5] # fifth character, equivalent to word[4]
```

```{python}
word[2:80] # over extending the index leads to just returning 
```

yet when referring to the index directly will result in a type error.

```{python}
# word[80] # IndexError
```

```{python}
word[2:6] # word is 6 characters long
```

```{python}
word[2:5] # although last char is at position 5, the last position is ignored.
```

`[?]` What might be another way to remember the indices in a slice?  
`[>]` The indices can be treated as through they point between the numbers.


```
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 | P | y | t | h | o | n |
 +---+---+---+---+---+---+
 0   1   2   3   4   5   6
-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1
```


`[?]` Can you change a single character of a string?

```{python}
# word[0] = 'j' # TypeError
```

You need to create a new string

```{python}
'j' + word[1:]
```

`[?]` How do you find the length of a string?

```{python}
len(word)
```

__Lists__



`[?]` What happens when you slice a list, what does it return?  
`[>]` Returns a new list


`[?]` What when you assign a variable with `alist[:]`?  
`[>]` A shallow copy is created of the list?


`[?]` What is a [shallow copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#shallow-vs-deep-copy)? <br>
`[>]` A shallow copy creates a new object and then creates references to the objects held within the original object to best possible extent. This is instead of deep copy which creates an object but then recursively copies all the objects within into this new object.

`[?]` When should the problem of deep copy and shallow copy be considered?  
`[>]` When you have an object that contains other objects like a `list` type.


`[?]` What problems can occur in deep copy?  
`[?]` Does Python offer a Copy-On-Write feature like Swift?  
`[?]` How might you use the `deepcopy()` function to mitigate this?


`[?]` How are lists different from strings when considering them to be a list of characters?
`[>]` String of Characters are immutible whilst lists are not. Python lists allows mixed data types whilst a string of characters is just that.

```{python}
squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
squares[0] # first items with index notation
squares[-1] # 25 
squares[-3:] # [9, 16, 25]
```

`[?]` What does slicing a list do?  
`[>]` It returns a new list.

```{python}
squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100] # Lists can be concatenated
```

```{python}
squares[-3] = 72  # Lists are mutable
squares
```

`[?]` What other data are `mutable` (like lists) and `immutable` (like strings)? 


`[?]` How do you replace a list of values in a list?

```{python}
letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']
letters
```

`[?]` What is a nifty way to remove a list of items in a list?

```{python}
letters[2:5] = [] # resize list
letters
```

```{python}
letters[:] = [] # remove all items
letters
```

`[?]` Can you use the `len` function on `list` types?  
`[?]` Is it possible to implement your own `len` method for your own data structure?


`[?]` How do you select a list of lists?

```{python}
a = ['a', 'b', 'c']
n = ['1', '2', '3']
c = [a, n]
c
```

```{python}
c[0][-3]
```

`[?]` What is evaluated first in the two lines?  
`[>]` For Line 1, both variablesa are assigned simultaneously. For Line 2, the LHS terms are evaluated first then the RHS.

```{python}
a, b = 2, 1
a, b = b, a + b
a, b
```

`[?]` When evaluating an integer as a boolean what does Python and C have in common?  
`[>]` Zero values are considered `False` and non-zero values are considered `True`

`[?]` How is an iterable object evaluated as a boolean?  
`[>]` Its `len()` result is considered and treated: if zero condition is `False`, if non-zero condition is `True`.

```{python}
a, b = 0, 1
while a < 1000:
    print(a, end=',')
    a, b = b, a+b
```

`[?]` What does the decorator property `@` in a class do?


### Control Flow Statements


__If Statements__

`[?]` What three statement can be used for an if statement in Python?  
`[>]` `if`, `elif`, `else`

`[?]` When would you use `elif` versus `else`?  <br>
`[>]` `elif` is great when you want to test for another condition. `else` is good _anything else_.

`[?]` What is the `elif` statement a substitute for?  
`[>]` It is a substitute for the `case` operator that is typically offered in a language like `C`. It prevents successive intentation or nesting of if statements.


__For Statements__

`[?]` How is Python's `for` statement different from `Pascals` or `C`?  <br>
`[>]` Pascals can only iterate over progressive number sequences, whilst in C you need to define the iteration and stopping condition. In Python it iterates until you reach the end of a collection, sort of generalising both problems.

`[?]` What is python documentation's recommendation on iterating and modifying a collection simultaneously?  
`[>]` It is tricky to get right and is it best if you create a new or work on a copy of the collection instead.

`[ ]` Create a minimal example to demo this.


__Range Statements__


Predict the following results:

```{python}
range(5)
```

```{python}
range(5, 10)
```

```{python}
range(0, 10, 3)
```

```{python}
range(-10, -100, -30)
```

`[?]` Why does range not give a list but you can iterate over it as if it is one?  
`[?]` It appears be an iterable object where the `range()` yields when iterated over until exhausted, this prevents a large range from having to be in memory.  

```{python}
sum(range(4)) # 0 + 1 + 2 + 3
```

`[?]` How do you convert a `range(a)` into a `list`?  <br>
`[>]` Use the `list()` function which takes an iterable object and puts its objects inside into a list

```{python}
list(range(4))
```

`[?]` Why do the terms in `range(b, a, c)` represent?  
`[>]` `a` is the end number and is never included by the range, `b` is the start point and is always yielded. `c` is the size of the step to add to the inital value. For `range(a)` is treated as `range(0, a, 1)` and `range(b, a)` is treated as `range(b, a, 1)`

```{python}
a = ['Mary', 'had', 'a', 'little', 'lamb']
for i in range(len(a)):
    print(i, a[i])
```

`[?]` How might you use the `range` function enumerate a collection whilst iterating it?  
`[>]` You can use `len(range(list))` to iterate over its yield. That yielded value can be used an index to both know it and access the list item at that index.  

`[?]` What alternatives does Python to iterating and enumerating a python list simulataneosly?  
`[>]` You can use the `enumerate()` statement instead. More info under [Looping Techniques](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#tut-loopidioms)


__Break and Continue, and Else Clauses on Loops__


`[?]` What and when is the `break` statement used for?  
`[>]` `break` is used to break out of a while or for loop.  

`[?]` What and where is the `else` statement used for?  
`[>]` `else` can be in a `for` and a `while` statement is executed when loop is exhausted either because nothing was run or the iterable is exhausted.  

`[?]` What is the time when the `else` clause isn't executed?  
`[>]` When there is a break in the loop.  

`[?]` Conceptually, what is `for`, `else` statement similar to?  
`[>]` Python's `try`, `else` statements.


`[?]` What is a `continue` statement?  
`[>]` The `continue` statement like the `pass` clause enables the compiler to do nothing under a block. If you have a loop which under an `if` evaluation simply need to iterate without doing anything else, that's where you use the `continue` clause.  

example of using a `continue` clause

```{python}
for num in range(2, 10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Found an even number", num)
        continue
    print("Found an odd number", num)

```

`[?]` What is a good use case for the `continue` statement?

`[?]` Can you create good examples where the `break`, `continue` and `else` statements are useful?

```{python}
for n in range(2, 10):
    for x in range(2, n):
        if n % x == 0:
            print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
            break
    else:
        # loop fell through without finding a factor
        print(n, 'is a prime number')
```

__Pass Statements__

`[?]` What does a pass statement do?  
`[>]` Nothing, just tells the compiler to jog on to the next block.


`[?]` Where might the `pass` clause be used for?


Busy-wait statements

```{python}
while True:
    pass # Busy-wait for keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
```

minimal classes

```{python}
class MyEmptyClass:
    pass
```

`[?]` what are minimal classes?


placeholder for methods whilst they are under-development

```{python}
def initlog(*args):
    pass # Remember to implement this!
```

`[?]` Where can you use the pass statement in your work?
