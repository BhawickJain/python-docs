### Defining and importing constants

Inpired by rubys/feedvalidator at [line 55](https://lgtm.com/projects/g/rubys/feedvalidator/snapshot/eb77aa864016e1071f37357746a3ad77de94432a/files/src/rdflib/syntax/parsers/RDFXMLHandler.py?sort=name&dir=ASC&mode=heatmap#L55)

You can import another file as a module and use the variables within as constants.

```{python}
from src.constants import C, PI, K, G
```

```{python}
C, PI  # Speed of Light and Pi
```

```{python}
K # Boltzmann constant
```

```{python}
G # Gravitational constant
```

But is it _really_ a constant?

```{python}
G = 0
```

```{python}
G
```

In spite of being from another module, you can't make it immutable.


`[?]` How do you make an imported variable immutable?
