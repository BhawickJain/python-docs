This is a structures walkthrough of the Python Documentation to understand the features the language has to offer. Initally starting withing [[py-docs-tutor](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)] and then moving on to specific libraries and modules.

Although basic, the aim is to capture details that I have missed my previous work.
